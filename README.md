# 🧠 BYT3 – Unit Testing & OOP Project  

## 📄 Project Overview  
This project was developed for the **BYT (Basics of Programming Technologies)** course.  
It demonstrates the use of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles and **Unit Testing** with **NUnit** in **C# (.NET 8)**.  
The solution includes both **geometry shape calculations** and a **basic calculator module**, each fully tested.

## 🧩 Geometry Module  
**Files:**  
- `Tutorial_Shapes_Project_Code.cs` – Contains `IShape` interface and shape classes (`Sphere`, `Cube`, `Cylinder`, `Rectangle`)  
- `Tutorial_Shapes_Project_CodeForTests.cs` – Additional implementations used for testing  

### ✨ Features  
- Calculates **area** and **volume** for multiple shapes  
- Uses **interfaces and encapsulation**  
- Unit tests ensure correct mathematical logic  

---

## 🧮 Calculator Module  
**Files:**  
- `Calculator.cs` – Core calculator logic (Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide)  
- `CalculatorTests.cs` – NUnit tests verifying all calculator functions  
- `Program.cs` – Console application to interact with the calculator  

### ✨ Features  
- Handles addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division  
- Prevents division by zero with exception handling  
- Console-based user interface  
- Fully tested with **NUnit** framework

## ⚙️ Technologies Used  
- **C# / .NET 8**  
- **NUnit Framework**  
- **JetBrains Rider IDE**
